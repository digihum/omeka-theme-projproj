Cinema Projectionist Theme 
===================

A theme for the Projection Project research project 2014-2017. The theme underwent a transformation in 2018-2019 with additional impact funding to improve the visual impact, and simplify access to the items.

It is highly customised and has a lot of overrides from default views. There are many references to Twitter Bootstrap, and the Javascript is still included across the site, though the latest theme CSS is hand-crafted and there is no Bootstrap CSS being used.

### Making changes to the CSS

*  CSS is compiled from SASS code under `styles/` using `npm-sass`
*  From the theme base directory run `npm style` to re-compile the stylesheet in `css/app.css`
